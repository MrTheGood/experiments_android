# Contributing Guidelines

This app is mostly to experiment and learn for myself. Therefore you shouldn't really contribute to this project.

HOWEVER, reporting any issues and giving feedback on my experiments is greatly appreciated. 
Also please tell me if you see any weird code or have ideas to improve the experiments.
